Movie Recommendation
====================

The MovieLens data sets are popular data sets for building
recommendation models in research, education and development. The
dataset (ml-latest-small) used in this demonstration contains 100,004
5-star ratings across 9125 movies created by 671 users between 9 January
1995 and 16 October 2016. The dataset records the userId, movieId,
rating, timestamp, title, and genres. The goal is to build a
recommendation model to recommend new movies to users.

This pre-built model has used the R language to build a recommendation
model to represent the knowledge discovered using a Smart Adaptive
Recommendations (SAR) algorithm. The knowledge representation is easy to
understand.

Usage
-----

The **demo** command applies the pre-built model to a demo data set with
records from 10 users and shows the recommendation results for 2 users.

The **print** command will display a textual summary of the model and
its build parameters.

The **score** command applies the pre-built model to a supplied data set
and shows the recommendation results for 2 users. Example **score**
command:

    $ ml score movies user10.csv
